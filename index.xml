      <description>Where I live there are essentially 2 options for(usable in this day and age) internet, you go with one of the local WISPs, or you use LTE in some form. The latter of the 2 is what I have ended up with after a few years of spotty and slow sevice with 2 different WISPs. It has some limitations, but I&amp;rsquo;m able to get 40-50Mbps down and 10-15Mbps up consistently. Someday Elon Musk and Starlink will save me, but for now it works.</description>

      <description>June 27th, 2020 My Dad, Jed and I went on this hike with the intention of doing a shakedown overnight trip to test our legs and gear for our upcoming PCT section hike. We arrived at the trail head at 7:30 that morning and started towards the Forni lake trail with plenty of mosquitoes to keep us company. The first leg of the journey was fairly uneventful, Iâ€™ve hiked to Forni lake probably a dozen times or so.</description>
